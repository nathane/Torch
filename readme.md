# <img src="torch-logo.png" alt="Torch Logo" align="right">Torch - Using Laravel's Illuminate Components Independently

Torch is a project to provide instructions and examples for using Illuminate components as standalone components in non-Laravel applications. The current `master` branch shows how to use Illuminate's `5.5` components.

**Note**: If you are working with an older project, you might have more success using the [5.1 components](https://github.com/mattstauffer/torch/tree/5.1) or the [4.2 components](https://github.com/mattstauffer/torch/tree/4.2).

## Usage

At the moment, the project is divided into many directories beneath `components` which will each contain an index file, usually written with [Slim](http://www.slimframework.com/). Navigate to that directory in your terminal and run the following to serve a web site from that directory:

```bash
$ composer install
$ php -S localhost:8000
```

Now you can visit [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) in your browser to view the output of each.

## Contributing

A few important notes:

1. The imagined end user is a developer of _any_ Symfony-HttpFoundation-using project copying the route closure directly into a project, so try to avoid using any Slim conventions and use as little preparation code outside the closure as possible.
2. While some components would be _easier_ to implement with a Laravel-style Application instance and a fuller bootstrap, I'd prefer we implement as many as possible _without_ loading Laravel's Service Providers.
3. Some components will require a bootstrap, and I hope we can come up with a Best-Practice bootstrap and Laravel-style Application instance for loading Service Providers, etc.

## Contributing

The [4.2](https://github.com/mattstauffer/torch/tree/4.2) and [5.1](https://github.com/mattstauffer/torch/tree/5.1) branches are still going strong, but this 5.5 branch is brand-new. I would appreciate any and all contributions.

At this point, most contributions could be just copying the 5.1 or 4.2 component over, adding `composer.json` if it doesn't exist (4.2), tweaking the old code for the new folder structure, and making sure our old code still works.

## But my framework doesn't use Symfony's HttpFoundation!

Many of these components will still work. But a few of them require HttpFoundation. `¯\(°_o)/¯`
